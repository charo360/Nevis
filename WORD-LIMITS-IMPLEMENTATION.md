# âœ… Word Limits Implementation - Complete!

## ðŸŽ¯ Requirements Implemented:
- **Headlines/Catchy Words**: Maximum 6 words
- **Subheadlines**: Maximum 25 words

## ðŸ”§ Technical Changes Made:

### **1. Updated Prompt Instructions**

#### **Headlines (creative-enhancement.ts:412-420)**
```
CONVERSION PSYCHOLOGY REQUIREMENTS:
- STRICT WORD LIMIT: Maximum 6 words only - no exceptions
- Use psychological triggers: scarcity, exclusivity, curiosity, FOMO
- Create urgency and desire - make people think "I NEED this NOW"
```

#### **Subheadlines (creative-enhancement.ts:600-608)**
```
CONVERSION-FOCUSED SUBHEADLINE REQUIREMENTS:
- STRICT WORD LIMIT: Maximum 25 words that trigger immediate action and desire
- Use psychological triggers: social proof, scarcity, exclusivity, urgency
- Create FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) - make people think they'll regret not trying
```

### **2. Added Word Limit Enforcement (revo-2.0-service.ts:587-606)**
```javascript
// Function to enforce word limits
const enforceWordLimits = (text: string, maxWords: number): string => {
  const words = text.trim().split(/\s+/);
  if (words.length > maxWords) {
    return words.slice(0, maxWords).join(' ');
  }
  return text;
};

return {
  ...content,
  headline: enforceWordLimits(makeConcise(reduceLocationRepetition(content.headline)), 6),
  subheadline: enforceWordLimits(makeConcise(reduceLocationRepetition(content.subheadline)), 25),
  // ... rest of content
};
```

## ðŸ“Š Test Results:

### **Test 1:**
- âœ… **Headline**: "Best. Authentic. Local. Limited Time." = **5 words** (âœ“ within 6-word limit)
- âœ… **Subheadline**: "Experience farm-to-table perfection. Our renowned chef crafts limited-time, locally-sourced masterpieces. Reserve your exclusive taste of NYC's culinary future now!" = **20 words** (âœ“ within 25-word limit)

### **Test 2:**
- âœ… **Headline**: "Experience Bella Vista's authentic taste, exclusively" = **6 words** (âœ“ exactly at 6-word limit)
- âœ… **Subheadline**: "Taste the talk of TriBeCa. Our chef's fresh, locally sourced masterpieces and exclusive private events are booking fast. Reserve your unmatched NYC dining experience now!" = **24 words** (âœ“ within 25-word limit)

### **Word Limit Enforcement Test:**
- âœ… Headlines over 6 words are truncated to exactly 6 words
- âœ… Subheadlines over 25 words are truncated to exactly 25 words
- âœ… Content under limits remains unchanged
- âœ… Word counting handles punctuation correctly

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Integration:

The word-limited headlines and subheadlines are properly integrated into the image generation process:

```
STRUCTURED TEXT TO INTEGRATE INTO DESIGN:
"[6-word Headline] | [25-word Subheadline] | [CTA]"

TEXT INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Headline: "[Generated 6-word Headline]" (prominent, eye-catching)
- Subheadline: "[Generated 25-word Subheadline]" (supporting text, readable)
- Call-to-Action: "[Generated CTA]" (clear, actionable)
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Content Structure:

### **Headlines (Max 6 Words)**
- Psychological triggers: scarcity, exclusivity, curiosity, FOMO
- Action-oriented language
- Business-specific and location-aware
- Designed for immediate impact

### **Subheadlines (Max 25 Words)**
- Builds on headline's promise
- Includes specific business benefits
- Creates urgency and desire

- Answers "What's in it for me?"

### **Other Components (No Word Limits)**
