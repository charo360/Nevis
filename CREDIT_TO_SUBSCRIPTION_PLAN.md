# Credit-Based to Subscription Migration Plan

## âœ… Start with Credits (Recommended)

### Why Credits First?
- **Faster Launch** - Less complex billing
- **Market Validation** - Test pricing and usage patterns  
- **Lower Risk** - Easier to adjust pricing
- **User Comfort** - Familiar pay-per-use model

## ðŸ”„ Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Launch Credits (Month 1-3)
```typescript
// Current system - keep as is
interface CreditSystem {
  credits: number;
  price: number;
  expiry?: Date; // Add this
}
```

### Phase 2: Add Expiry (Month 2)
```typescript
// Prevent credit hoarding
const CREDIT_PACKAGES = {
  small: { credits: 10, price: 9.99, expiryDays: 90 },
  medium: { credits: 25, price: 19.99, expiryDays: 90 },
  large: { credits: 50, price: 34.99, expiryDays: 90 }
};
```

### Phase 3: Introduce Subscriptions (Month 4-6)
```typescript
// Hybrid system
interface User {
  credits: number; // Legacy credits (honor these)
  subscription?: {
    plan: 'starter' | 'business' | 'agency';
    monthlyCredits: number;
    usedThisMonth: number;
    resetDate: Date;
  };
}
```

### Phase 4: Migration Push (Month 7+)
- Stop selling credits to new users
- Offer migration incentives
- Grandfather existing credits

## ðŸ’¡ Quick Revenue Fixes (Implement Now)

### 1. Add Credit Expiry
```sql
-- Add expiry to credit purchases
ALTER TABLE credit_purchases ADD COLUMN expiry_date TIMESTAMP;
UPDATE credit_purchases SET expiry_date = created_at + INTERVAL '90 days';
```

### 2. Smaller Packages
```typescript
// Force more frequent purchases
const NEW_PACKAGES = {
  starter: { credits: 5, price: 7.99 },   // $1.60/credit
  basic: { credits: 15, price: 19.99 },   // $1.33/credit
  pro: { credits: 30, price: 34.99 }      // $1.17/credit
};
```

### 3. Usage Notifications
- "Credits expire in 7 days!"
- "You're running low on credits"
- "Buy more to continue creating"

## ðŸ“Š Data to Track (For Migration)

### User Behavior
```typescript
interface UsageAnalytics {
  averageCreditsPerMonth: number;
  generationsPerWeek: number;
  preferredRevoModel: string;
  timeToExhaustion: number; // Days to use all credits
}
```

### Revenue Metrics
- Average revenue per user (ARPU)
- Credit purchase frequency
- Heavy vs light users
- Churn after credit exhaustion

## ðŸŽ¯ Migration Triggers

### When to Introduce Subscriptions:
- âœ… 100+ active users
- âœ… Clear usage patterns identified
- âœ… Revenue > $2k/month
- âœ… User feedback collected

### Migration Incentives:
- "Save 40% with monthly plans!"
- "Never run out of credits again"
- "Exclusive features for subscribers"
- "First month free for existing users"

## ðŸ’° Revenue Comparison

### Credits Only (Current):
- User buys 50 credits for $35
- Uses over 3 months
- Revenue: $35 total

### Credits + Expiry:
- User buys 20 credits for $20 (90-day expiry)
- Buys again in 2 months
- Revenue: $40 in 3 months

### Subscription (Future):
- User pays $19/month for 50 credits
- Revenue: $57 in 3 months (63% increase!)

## ðŸš€ Implementation Steps

### Week 1: Add Expiry System
```typescript
// Add to existing credit service
export class CreditExpiryService {
  static addExpiry(credits: number): Date {
    return new Date(Date.now() + 90 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
  }
}
```

### Week 2: Update UI
- Show expiry dates
- Add urgency notifications
- Display "days remaining"

### Week 3: Analyze Data
