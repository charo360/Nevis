console.log('\n📊 STRATEGIC LOCATION DISTRIBUTION:');
console.log('✅ 40% of content: INCLUDES location for local credibility');
console.log('✅ 60% of content: EXCLUDES location for universal appeal');

console.log('\n🎯 EXPECTED CONTENT VARIATIONS:');

testScenarios.forEach((test, index) => {
  console.log(`\n--- ${test.scenario} ---`);
  
  console.log('\n📍 WITH LOCATION (40% of content):');
  console.log('Purpose: Local credibility, community connection, geographic targeting');
  console.log(`Headline: "${test.businessName} - Nairobi's Tech Leader"`);
  console.log(`Subheadline: "Trusted by ${test.location} customers since 2020"`);
  console.log(`Caption: "Join thousands of satisfied ${test.location} customers who trust ${test.businessName}..."`);
  console.log(`CTA: "Visit our ${test.location} store today"`);
  
  console.log('\n🌐 WITHOUT LOCATION (60% of content):');
  console.log('Purpose: Product specifications, universal appeal, broader market');
  console.log(`Headline: "iPhone 15 Pro 128GB - $999 Today"`);
  console.log(`Subheadline: "A17 Pro chip meets 48MP Pro camera"`);
  console.log(`Caption: "The iPhone 15 Pro with 128GB storage delivers incredible performance..."`);

console.log('✅ Same decision applied to all content components (headline, subheadline, caption, CTA)');
console.log('✅ Location strategy passed through businessDetails.locationStrategy');

console.log('\n🧪 TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:');
console.log('1. Generate multiple pieces of content for the same business');
console.log('2. Observe that ~40% mention location while ~60% focus on products');
console.log('3. Location-free content should emphasize specs, pricing, features');
console.log('4. Location-included content should use it for credibility and community');

console.log('\n📊 EXPECTED DISTRIBUTION OVER 10 GENERATIONS:');
console.log('Location mentions: ~4 out of 10 posts');
console.log('Product-focused: ~6 out of 10 posts');
console.log('Variety: No repetitive location patterns');
