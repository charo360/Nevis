# Nevis Revo Version Branches

This document outlines the different Revo version branches and their intended purposes.

## Branch Strategy

Each Revo version is an **independent branch** that can evolve separately without merging back to main. This allows us to:
- Maintain multiple versions simultaneously
- Add features independently to each version
- Keep stable versions while experimenting with new features
- Provide different feature sets for different use cases

## Version Branches

### ðŸš€ **Revo 1.0** (`revo-1.0`)
**Standard Model - Stable Foundation**
*(Renamed from `standardmodel`)*

## Development Workflow

### Working on Revo 1.0:
```bash
git checkout revo-1.0
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "Revo 1.0: Add feature X"
```

### Working on Revo 1.5:
```bash
git checkout revo-1.5
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "Revo 1.5: Add feature Y"
```

### Working on Revo 2.0:
```bash
git checkout revo-2.0
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "Revo 2.0: Add feature Z"
```

### Key Principles:
1. **No merging between versions** - Each evolves independently
2. **Version-specific commits** - Always prefix commits with version
3. **Independent features** - Features can be different between versions
4. **Progressive enhancement** - 1.0 â†’ 1.5 â†’ 2.0 represents evolution

## Current Status

| Version | Branch | Status | AI Engine | Features | Quality |
|---------|--------|--------|-----------|----------|---------|
| Revo 1.0 | `revo-1.0` | âœ… Production | Reliable Engine | Standard | Stable |
| Revo 1.5 | `revo-1.5` | âœ… Production | Advanced Engine | Enhanced | Superior |
| Revo 2.0 | `revo-2.0` | ðŸš§ Development | Next-Gen Engine | Revolutionary | TBD |
