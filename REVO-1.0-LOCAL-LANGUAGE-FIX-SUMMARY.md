# Revo 1.0 Local Language Support Fix

## Problem Description

The application has a toggle for local language support that should include local languages in content generation based on the user's brand profile location. However, there was an inconsistency across model versions:

- **Revo 1.5 and Revo 2.0**: ✅ Correctly support local languages when the toggle is enabled
- **Revo 1.0**: ❌ Only generates content in English, even when the local language toggle is turned on

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the `generateUnifiedContent` function in `src/ai/creative-enhancement.ts`. While individual functions like `generateBusinessSpecificHeadline` and `generateBusinessSpecificSubheadline` had proper local language handling, the unified content generation function was missing the local language requirements section in its AI prompt.

### What Was Missing

The `generateUnifiedContent` function's prompt was missing:
- Local language requirements section
- Conditional logic for `useLocalLanguage` parameter
- Specific local language context integration
- Dynamic local language generation guidance

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Local Language Section to Unified Content Generation

Added comprehensive local language handling to the `generateUnifiedContent` function in `src/ai/creative-enhancement.ts`:

```typescript
${useLocalLanguage ? `
LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS:
- Use English as the primary language (70%)
- Include natural local language elements (30%) - words, phrases, expressions that locals would use
- Mix English with local language for an authentic, natural feel
- Make it sound natural and culturally appropriate for ${location}
- Examples: "Welcome to [Business Name]" + local greeting, or "Best [Service]" + local term
- Avoid 100% local language - aim for natural mixing

${localLanguageContext ? `
SPECIFIC LOCAL LANGUAGE CONTEXT FOR ${location.toUpperCase()}:
- Primary Language: ${localLanguageContext.primaryLanguage || 'English'}
- Common Phrases: ${localLanguageContext.commonPhrases?.join(', ') || 'N/A'}
- Business Terms: ${localLanguageContext.businessTerms?.join(', ') || 'N/A'}
- Cultural Nuances: ${localLanguageContext.culturalNuances || 'N/A'}
- Marketing Style: ${localLanguageContext.marketingStyle || 'N/A'}
- Local Expressions: ${localLanguageContext.localExpressions?.join(', ') || 'N/A'}

USE THESE SPECIFIC TERMS:
- Incorporate the common phrases naturally: ${localLanguageContext.commonPhrases?.slice(0, 3).join(', ') || 'N/A'}
- Use business terms when relevant: ${localLanguageContext.businessTerms?.slice(0, 2).join(', ') || 'N/A'}
- Apply the cultural nuances: ${localLanguageContext.culturalNuances || 'N/A'}
- Follow the marketing style: ${localLanguageContext.marketingStyle || 'N/A'}
- Include local expressions: ${localLanguageContext.localExpressions?.slice(0, 2).join(', ') || 'N/A'}` : ''}

UNIFIED CONTENT LOCAL LANGUAGE GUIDANCE:
- Add contextually appropriate local greetings to headlines based on business type
- Use local expressions in subheadlines that relate to the specific business industry
- Include relevant local terms in captions that match the business offerings and target audience
- Mix naturally: Don't force local language - only add when it makes sense and flows well
- Keep it relevant: Use local language that relates to the specific business context and audience
- Maintain engagement: Ensure the local language enhances rather than distracts from the message
- Be dynamic: Generate unique local language for each business, avoid repetitive patterns
- Think creatively: Use different local greetings, expressions, and terms for each business type

DYNAMIC LOCAL LANGUAGE GENERATION:
- For RESTAURANTS: Use food-related local terms, hospitality greetings, taste expressions
- For FITNESS: Use energy/motivation local terms, health expressions, action words
- For TECH: Use innovation local terms, future expressions, digital concepts
- For BEAUTY: Use beauty-related local terms, confidence expressions, aesthetic words
- For FINANCE: Use money/security local terms, trust expressions, financial concepts
- For HEALTHCARE: Use health/wellness local terms, care expressions, medical concepts
- For EDUCATION: Use learning local terms, growth expressions, knowledge concepts
- For REAL ESTATE: Use home/property local terms, dream expressions, space concepts
- VARY the local language: Don't use the same phrases for every business
- BE CONTEXTUAL: Match local language to the specific business industry and services` : `
LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS:
- Use English only, do not use local language
- Keep content in English for universal accessibility
- Focus on local cultural understanding in English rather than local language mixing`}
```

### 2. Verified Existing Infrastructure

Confirmed that the supporting infrastructure was already in place:
- ✅ `observeLocal` parameter properly passed from content generator to service
- ✅ Local language context generation function exists
- ✅ Individual content generation functions have local language support
- ✅ Parameter flow from UI toggle to backend is working

## Testing Results

### Code Structure Verification
- ✅ Content Generator: Correctly passes observeLocal parameter
- ✅ Content Generator: Has local language control comment
- ✅ Revo 1.0 Service: Has observeLocal parameter in interface
- ✅ Revo 1.0 Service: Passes observeLocal to content generation functions
- ✅ Revo 1.0 Service: Generates local language context
- ✅ Creative Enhancement: Has useLocalLanguage parameter
- ✅ Creative Enhancement: Has unified content local language guidance

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### When Local Language Toggle is ENABLED (`useLocalLanguage: true`)
- Content will include natural local language elements (30% local, 70% English)
- Local greetings, expressions, and business terms will be incorporated
- Content will feel authentic to the specific location/culture
- Examples for Kenya: "Karibu to our restaurant", "Chakula bora", "Asante for choosing us"

### When Local Language Toggle is DISABLED (`useLocalLanguage: false`)
- Content will be generated in English only
- No local language words or phrases will be included
- Focus on universal messaging that works across all markets

## Consistency Achieved

Now all Revo model versions handle local language consistently:
- **Revo 1.0**: ✅ Supports local language toggle
- **Revo 1.5**: ✅ Supports local language toggle  
- **Revo 2.0**: ✅ Supports local language toggle

## Files Modified

1. `src/ai/creative-enhancement.ts` - Added local language section to `generateUnifiedContent` function

## Impact

- ✅ Fixes local language inconsistency in Revo 1.0
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ Improves user experience for international markets
- ✅ Ensures feature parity across all model versions

## Next Steps for Testing

1. Test the application with the local language toggle enabled for different locations
2. Verify that Revo 1.0 now generates content with local language elements when toggle is on
3. Confirm that content remains in English when toggle is off
4. Compare output quality with Revo 1.5 and 2.0 to ensure consistency
